<h2><b>Where on Earth Ulaanbaatar is located?</b> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h2>
<p> Ulaanbaatar, literally "Red Hero" and short for UB is the capital and largest city of Mongolia. It is situated between Russia to the north and China to the south, where it neighbours the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Mongolia does not share a border with Kazakhstan, although only 37 kilometres separate them.
Ulaanbaatar was founded in 1639 as a nomadic Buddhist monastic centre.</p>

<h2>So! When is the best time to travel to Mongolia?</h2>
<p> Mongolia has four seasons and each has its own soul. The country has an average of 250 annual days of sunshine.
Hence many refer to Mongolia as “The Land of Eternal Blue Sky”. </p>
<p>Undoubtedly the most popular period of the year visited by tourists is summer. The weather is very pleasant and you can attend Naadam festival in July while experiencing wrestling, horse racing and archery.
If you are into hiking photography, the Eagle festival which takes place in automn might be something you want to research a bit more. </p>
